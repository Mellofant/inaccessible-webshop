      Welcome to our art supply online shop!<br /><br />

      We have everything an artist could possibly need to create master pieces.
      But what does art actually mean? What is an artist? What is artwork?
      <br /><br />

      Art is a diverse range of human activity, and resulting product, that
      involves creative or imaginative talent expressive of technical
      proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas. There is no
      generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, and its
      interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures.
      The three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and
      architecture. Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as
      literature, music, film and other media such as interactive media, are
      included in a broader definition of the arts. Until the 17th century, art
      referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or
      sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic
      considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and
      distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or
      applied arts. The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity
      and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as
      aesthetics. The resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields
      of art criticism and the history of art. An artist is a person engaged in
      an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts, or demonstrating
      an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse
      refers to a practitioner in the visual arts only. However, the term is
      also often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business
      context, for musicians and other performers (although less often for
      actors). "Artiste" (French for artist) is a variant used in English in
      this context, but this use has become rare. Use of the term "artist" to
      describe writers is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to
      contexts like used in criticism. A work of art, artwork, art piece, piece
      of art or art object is an artistic creation of aesthetic value. Except
      for "work of art", which may be used of any work regarded as art in its
      widest sense, including works from literature and music, these terms apply
      principally to tangible, physical forms of visual art: An example of fine
      art, such as a painting or sculpture; an object that has been designed
      specifically for its aesthetic appeal, such as a piece of jewellery; an
      object that has been designed for aesthetic appeal as well as functional
      purpose, as in interior design and much folk art; an object created for
      principally or entirely functional, religious or other non-aesthetic
      reasons which has come to be appreciated as art (often later, or by
      cultural outsiders); a non-ephemeral photograph or film; a work of
      installation art or conceptual art. Used more broadly, the term is less
      commonly applied to: A fine work of architecture or landscape design; a
      production of live performance, such as theater, ballet, opera,
      performance art, musical concert and other performing arts, and other
      ephemeral, non-tangible creations.
